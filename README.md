## üîë Authentication Guide

### Google OAuth Setup

1. **Create Google Cloud Project**
   - Visit [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select an existing one

2. **Enable APIs**
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services"
   - Enable "Blogger API"

3. **Create OAuth Credentials**
   - Go to "Credentials"
   - Click "Create Credentials" > "OAuth client ID"
   - Select "Web application"
   - Add authorized origins and redirect URIs
     * For local development: `http://localhost:3000`
     * For production: Your actual domain

4. **Configure Consent Screen**
   - Set up OAuth consent screen
   - Add required scopes:
      * `.../auth/blogger` (Blogger API)
      * `email`
      * `profile`

5. **Security Considerations**
   - Keep your Client ID and credentials confidential
   - Never commit sensitive information to version control
   - Use environment variables for sensitive data

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure your Google account has Blogger access
- Verify Client ID and scopes match your application
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure browser supports modern OAuth flows
- If you receive 401/403 errors, remove the local token (`localStorage` key: `blogcraft_token`) and sign in again
- The project uses `react-scripts` with `--openssl-legacy-provider` set in `npm` scripts for compatibility on Node 18

## üß™ Build & Test

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

The production build will be created in `build/`.

## üïí Background Scheduler Service

BlogCraft includes an optional Node.js scheduler that can publish posts at a later time even when the main UI is closed.

1. Add scheduled posts to `scheduled-posts.json` (see `scheduled-posts.example.json` for the structure).
2. Export a Blogger access token in `BLOGGER_TOKEN` and optionally set `SCHEDULED_POSTS_FILE`.
3. Run the service:
   ```bash
   npm run scheduler
   ```
The process will stay running and publish each post at its configured `publishDate`.
